# eth-price-scraper
In the "Ethereum Price Scraper" project, I utilize Python libraries like requests, json, and pprint to scrape real-time Ethereum (ETH) price data from the CoinMarketCap API.

For future work, my goal is to dive into historical data, creating a dataset for analyzing indicators such as Return on Investment (ROI) over holding ETH over specific intervals, like 1 year. However, it's important to note that access to this historical data is exclusively available through the paid plans offered by the CoinMarketCap API so will be paused until we find another source of this historical data for free.
